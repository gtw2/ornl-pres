\frametitle{Conclusions}
We have developed a customizable method of diverting material
from inside Cyclus facilities.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Work has been done on the detection of two
	different types of diversion: Nefarious and Operator
\end{itemize}
Pyre was demonstrated to function as both LWR and SFR
reprocessing method
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generic facility capable of modeling multiple facility layouts
\end{itemize}
Key measurement points were identified with sensitivity analysis performed over the primary sub-processes.

\frametitle{Future Work}
This work laid the groundwork for future research into sub-facility modeling and diversion detection. Future additions to this work could include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reducing time step length for higher fidelity
	\item Expand on operational parameter relationships with further experimental data
	\item Incorporate multiple data points for CUSUM detection
\end{itemize}
